The course is an introduction to Web and Media Design. During the lectures the students will be guided through a user experience-oriented approach. Instead of merely focusing on how things look on the web, the aim is to actually work on how products are conceived and how designers can improve the overall UX. For instance, does the user find what he or she needs in the interface? Why should we place that button here instead of over there? Does the on-boarding experience deliver everything the user needs the first time he or she uses the product? What are the tools that help us understand how the users are engaging in our product? How can we test the comprehensibility of our interface?

## Teaching format

The course is basically split in two yet connected tracks. The first track touches web practises, user experience methods and design deliverables. After a brief introduction on each topic with real-world examples, a series of games, exercises or discussions will follow afterwards. The second branch touches web development. We will go through session-based workshops in order to learn and understand how to develop a simple website with web languages such as HTML and CSS.

## Assessment

Written and oral. Students will be assessed considering the results of: 

- the exercises assigned during the course
- a discussion on a final assignment based on one of the topics touched during the course (to be defined together with the lecturer)
- documentation

orâ€¨

- the exercises assigned during the course
- integration of the subject in the final semester project with a dedicated and critical discussion related to the choices made in terms of web or product design
- documentation
