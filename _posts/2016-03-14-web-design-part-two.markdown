## A Dao of Web Design [^1]

Relationship between the printed page and the web (the browser, our canvas)

- It’s time to really understand the relationship between the parent and the child, and to let the child go its own way in the world.
- The web is a new medium, although it has emerged from the medium of printing, whose skills, design language and conventions strongly influence it

The technology is pretty young and therefor eager to new explorations and experiments. We should not constrain ourselves by the heritage of Desktop Publishing.

- We need to understand which of these lessons are appropriate for the web, and which mere rituals.

Designers usually want to control everything, something which is commonly know on the web as "pixel perfection" but 

- we need to rethink this role, to abandon control, and seek a new relationship with the page.
- Make pages which are accessible, regardless of the browser, platform or screen that your reader chooses or must use to access your pages.
- The web’s greatest strength, I believe, is often seen as a limitation, as a defect. It is the nature of the web to be flexible, and it should be our role as designers and developers to embrace this flexibility, and produce pages which, by being flexible, are accessible to all.
- The web wasn't designed to be constrained to a single context [^10]

## Responsive Web Design: Missing the Point 
- The point of creating adaptive sites is to create functional (and hopefully optimal) user experiences for a growing number of web-enabled devices and contexts [^2]
- Responsive Web design is the approach that suggests that design and development should respond to the user's behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation [^4]

## Resposive Web Design [^8]
- Fluid grids that ebb and flow with a devices’ screen size
- Flexible images and media that keep content intact on any resolution
- Media queries allowing designs to adapt by establishing dimension breakpoints

## Mobile first [^5]
- Mobile forces you to focus: Mobile devices require software development teams to focus on only the most important data and actions in an application. You have to prioritize.
- Google searches take place on mobile devices than on computers in 10 countries including the US and Japan. [^6]
- Allows websites to reach more people
- Forces designers to focus on core content and functionality
- Lets designers innovate and take advantage of new technologies (geolocation, touch events and more) [^7]
- Mobile users will do anything and everything desktop users will do, provided it’s presented in a usable way

## Progressive enhancement
- Progressive enhancement uses web technologies in a layered fashion that allows everyone to access the basic content and functionality of a web page, using any browser or Internet connection, while also providing an enhanced version of the page to those with more advanced browser software or greater bandwidth. [^9]

## Content first
- Structuring content first creates content focus and hierarchy [^7]
- At the end of the day, devices will come and go and technological trends will wax and wane, but content, business goals and user goals remain. [^7]
- By first creating an experience that prioritizes a worst-case mobile scenario, you ensure that your users will be able to accomplish their goals despite a lot of factors working against them. [^7]
- In short, if you can support the mobile web, you can support anything. [^7]

- The device landscape is constanslty changing. Capabilities are constantly changing. _Properly structured content_ is portable to future platforms [^11]
- Don't assume users want different content simply because of the platform they're using [^12]
- http://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/progressive_enhancement.jpg
- But all anyone needs to do on the site is read some words. Period. A single column of text accomplished that quite well.
- Properly structured content is portable to future platform [^13]

## For a future-friendly web [^3]
- The web is not one-dimensional
- The power of the web is its ubiquitousness
- We need to reconsider the content we create and the context in which people interact with our content
-  We need to respect people's time and give them relevant, purposeful content without the extra cruft.
- Content like water. Think of your core content as a fluid thing that gets poured into a huge number of containers. 
- Mobile is more than just a smaller screen
- The combination of mobile-first and responsive web design is a good idea.
- Progressive enhancement plays an essential role in future-friendly design.
- Design for touch
