## A Dao of Web Design [^1]

Relationship between the printed page and the web (the browser, our canvas)

> It’s time to really understand the relationship between the parent and the child, and to let the child go its own way in the world.

> The web is a new medium, although it has emerged from the medium of printing, whose skills, design language and conventions strongly influence it.
— John Allsopp

The technology is pretty young and therefor eager to new explorations and experiments. We should not constrain ourselves by the heritage of Desktop Publishing.

> We need to understand which of these lessons are appropriate for the web, and which mere rituals.

Designers usually want to control everything, something which is commonly know on the web as "pixel perfection" but 

> we need to rethink this role, to abandon control, and seek a new relationship with the page.

> Make pages which are accessible, regardless of the browser, platform or screen that your reader chooses or must use to access your pages.

> The web’s greatest strength, I believe, is often seen as a limitation, as a defect. It is the nature of the web to be flexible, and it should be our role as designers and developers to embrace this flexibility, and produce pages which, by being flexible, are accessible to all.

## Responsive Web Design: Missing the Point [^2]

> The point of creating adaptive sites is to create functional (and hopefully optimal) user experiences for a growing number of web-enabled devices and contexts

## For a future-friendly web [^3]

> The web is not one-dimensional

> The power of the web is its ubiquitousness

> We need to reconsider the content we create and the context in which people interact with our content

>  We need to respect people's time and give them relevant, purposeful content without the extra cruft.

> Content like water. Think of your core content as a fluid thing that gets poured into a huge number of containers. 

> Mobile is more than just a smaller screen

> The combination of mobile-first and responsive web design is a good idea.

> Progressive enhancement plays an essential role in future-friendly design.

> Design for touch

## Responsive Web Design: What It Is and How To Use It [^4]

> Responsive Web design is the approach that suggests that design and development should respond to the user's behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation

## Mobile first [^5]

> Mobile forces you to focus: Mobile devices require software development teams to focus on only the most important data and actions in an application. You have to prioritize.
